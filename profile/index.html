      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Utah native, born and raised near Salt Lake City. I am currently studying Computer Science at BYU and
        spend a lot of my time coding for both school assignments and for hobby projects. In the Summer I love hiking
        and being outdoors, but in the Winter there's nothing better than sitting indoors by a heater ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently really intrigued by self hosting applications that handle photos, videos, book, budgets, and any
        other useful digital tool that traditionally are managed by large cloud corporations.
